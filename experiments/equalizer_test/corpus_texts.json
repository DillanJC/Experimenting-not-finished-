  "Understanding the Pipeline Concept\n\nA CPU pipeline allows multiple instructions to be processed simultaneously at different stages, similar to an assembly line. While one instruction is being executed, the next can be decoded, and another can be fetched. This parallelism significantly improves throughput.",
  "Fetch Stage\n\n**Purpose**: Retrieve the next instruction from memory\n\n**Process**:\n- The Program Counter (PC) contains the address of the next instruction\n- The CPU sends this address to the instruction cache (L1 I-cache)\n- If the instruction is in cache (cache hit), it's retrieved quickly\n- If not (cache miss), the CPU fetches it from main memory\n- The instruction is placed in the instruction fetch buffer\n- The PC is incremented to point to the next instruction\n\n**Key Components**: Program Counter, Instruction Cache, Memory Management Unit",
  "Decode Stage\n\n**Purpose**: Interpret the instruction and prepare operands\n\n**Process**:\n- The instruction decoder analyzes the binary instruction\n- Determines the operation type (ADD, LOAD, BRANCH, etc.)\n- Identifies source and destination registers\n- Extracts immediate values or memory addresses\n- Generates control signals for the execute stage\n- Reads required data from the register file\n- Handles any necessary sign extension or data formatting\n\n**Key Components**: Instruction Decoder, Register File, Control Unit",
  "Execute Stage\n\n**Purpose**: Perform the actual computation or operation\n\n**Process**:\n- Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) performs mathematical/logical operations\n- Load/Store Unit handles memory operations\n- Branch Unit processes conditional jumps and calls\n- Floating-Point Unit handles decimal calculations\n- Results are computed but not yet stored\n- Branch predictions are verified (if applicable)\n- Memory addresses are calculated for load/store operations\n\n**Key Components**: ALU, Load/Store Unit, Branch Unit, FPU",
  "Writeback Stage\n\n**Purpose**: Store results and update system state\n\n**Process**:\n- Results from the execute stage are written back to registers\n- Memory writes are committed to the data cache\n- Processor flags (zero, carry, overflow) are updated\n- Branch mispredictions trigger pipeline flushes\n- Exception handling occurs if needed\n- The instruction is marked as completed\n\n**Key Components**: Register File, Data Cache, Status Registers",
  "Pipeline Hazards and Solutions\n\n**Data Hazards**: When instructions depend on previous results\n- Solution: Forwarding/bypassing data directly between stages\n\n**Control Hazards**: When branches change the instruction flow\n- Solution: Branch prediction and speculative execution\n\n**Structural Hazards**: When hardware resources are insufficient\n- Solution: Duplicate resources or pipeline stalling",
  "Modern Enhancements\n\n- **Superscalar**: Multiple pipelines operating in parallel\n- **Out-of-order execution**: Instructions execute when operands are ready\n- **Speculative execution**: Predicting and executing likely paths\n- **Deep pipelines**: Modern CPUs have 10-20+ pipeline stages for higher clock speeds\n\nThis pipeline design allows modern CPUs to achieve instruction throughput approaching one instruction per clock cycle, despite each individual instruction requiring multiple cycles to complete.",
  "State what we want to prove**\nWe want to prove that √2 is irrational (cannot be expressed as a ratio of two integers).",
  "Set up proof by contradiction**\nAssume, for the sake of contradiction, that √2 is rational.",
  "Express the assumption mathematically**\nIf √2 is rational, then √2 = a/b where a and b are integers, b ≠ 0, and gcd(a,b) = 1.\n(Note: We can always reduce a fraction to lowest terms, so we assume gcd(a,b) = 1)",
  "Analyze what this equation tells us**\nSince 2b² = a², the right side (a²) is even because it equals 2 times an integer.\nTherefore, a² is even.",
  "Conclude that a must be even**\nIf a² is even, then a must be even (since if a were odd, then a² would be odd).",
  "Express a as an even number**\nSince a is even, we can write a = 2k for some integer k.",
  "Substitute back into our equation**\n2b² = a² = (2k)² = 4k²",
  "Analyze this new equation**\nSince b² = 2k², we see that b² is even (it equals 2 times an integer).\nTherefore, b² is even, which means b must be even.",
  "Identify the contradiction**\nWe now have:\n- a is even (from Step 7)\n- b is even (from Step 11)\n- But we assumed gcd(a,b) = 1 (from Step 3)\n\nIf both a and b are even, then they share a common factor of 2, so gcd(a,b) ≥ 2.\nThis contradicts our assumption that gcd(a,b) = 1.",
  "Conclude**\nSince our assumption leads to a contradiction, our assumption must be false.\nTherefore, √2 cannot be rational, which means √2 is irrational. ∎",

  "Understanding the CRISPR System Components\n\nCRISPR consists of two main molecular components:\n- **Cas protein** (commonly Cas9): An endonuclease enzyme that cuts DNA\n- **Guide RNA (gRNA)**: A synthetic RNA molecule that directs Cas9 to the target DNA sequence",
  "Guide RNA Design and Target Recognition\n\nThe guide RNA contains a ~20-nucleotide sequence complementary to the target DNA sequence. When introduced into a cell, the gRNA forms a complex with the Cas9 protein through specific binding sites on the Cas9 enzyme.",
  "DNA Scanning and PAM Sequence Recognition\n\nThe Cas9-gRNA complex scans the genome looking for a **Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM)** sequence. For Cas9, this is typically \"NGG\" (where N is any nucleotide). The PAM sequence is essential - without it, Cas9 cannot bind to or cut the DNA.",
  "DNA Unwinding and Guide RNA Hybridization\n\nOnce a PAM sequence is found, Cas9 unwinds the double-stranded DNA helix. The guide RNA then attempts to base-pair with the DNA strand adjacent to the PAM. If there's sufficient complementarity (typically requiring perfect or near-perfect matching), stable hybridization occurs.",
  "Conformational Change and DNA Cleavage\n\nSuccessful gRNA-DNA hybridization triggers a conformational change in Cas9, activating its nuclease domains:\n- **HNH domain**: Cuts the DNA strand complementary to the gRNA\n- **RuvC domain**: Cuts the non-complementary DNA strand\nThis creates a double-strand break (DSB) typically 3 base pairs upstream of the PAM sequence.",
  "Cellular DNA Repair Response\n\nThe cell's natural DNA repair mechanisms respond to the double-strand break through two main pathways:\n- **Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ)**: Often introduces small insertions or deletions (indels), potentially disrupting gene function\n- **Homology-Directed Repair (HDR)**: If a DNA template is provided, precise edits can be made through homologous recombination",
  "Final Outcome\n\nDepending on the repair pathway and whether a template is provided, the result can be:\n- Gene knockout (through NHEJ-induced disruption)\n- Precise gene editing (through HDR with a provided template)\n- Gene insertion (using HDR with a donor template containing new sequences)\n\nThis molecular precision makes CRISPR a powerful tool for targeted genome modification across many organisms and cell types."
